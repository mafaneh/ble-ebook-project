## Overview of folders and files
This is the companion repository for the e-book: **"Bluetooth 5 &amp; Bluetooth Low Energy: A Developer's Guide"**

In this repository, you will find a few different folders:
- **Ellisys sniffer captures**: Capture files that the reader can view in the Ellisys Analyzer Software and analyze to get a better understanding of Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth 5.
- **Gateway**: Source code for the "Gateway" device, which is part of the book's Main Project (Home Automation) exercise (for the nRF52840 chipset).
- **HelloWorld with Security**: A simple BLE "Hello World" example with added Security (LE Secure Connections, MITM protection, Numeric Comparison) (for the nRF52840 chipset). *This example has not been migrated to the new 15.2.0 nRF5 SDK yet. It still uses SDK v 14.2.0.*
- **HelloWorld**: A simple BLE "Hello World" example (for the nRF52840 chipset).
- **HelloWorld nRF52832**: A simple "Hello World" example implemented for the nRF52832 chipset.
- **Main Project SES files**: Main Project Segger Embedded Studio (SES) Solution and Project files. (for the nRF52840 chipset)
- **Remote Control**: Source code for the "Remote Control" device, which is part of the book's Main Project (Home Automation) exercise (for the nRF52840 chipset).
- **Video Tutorials PDFs**: PDFs for the Video Tutorials (video tutorials included only with the **Accelerator** and **Ultimate** bundles).
- **nRF5_SDK_current**: nRF5 SDK snapshot (version 15.2.0).
- **nRF5_SDK_14.2.0_17b948a**: Previous version of the SDK (14.2.0).

## The "Bluetooth 5 and Bluetooth Low Energy: A Developer's Guide" e-book
**The FIRST and ONLY practical Bluetooth Low Energy developer guide!**

_Stop reading books that sound good on paper, but leave you wondering how to get started with development!_

This 300+ page e-book will guide you through building a complete Home Automation project while learning the basics and advanced aspects of Bluetooth 5 and Bluetooth Low Energy development. You also get access to the full source code used to build the project as well as **11 Video Tutorials**.

The book covers the following topics:

- Basics of Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth 5
- Utilizing Bluetooth 5 to achieve 2x speed, 4x range, and 8x advertising capacity
- Designing your GATT, GAP and optimizing the different system parameters
- Tutorials for using the essential tools for developing for Bluetooth Low Energy
- Achieving optimum power consumption and battery life
- Debugging device communication and connections
- Practical examples using the Nordic nRF52840 chipset (using SDK v 15.2.0)
- Complete source code for building the Main Project for the book
- **11 Video tutorials including: using the nRF Sniffer, the Ellisys Bluetooth Tracker, the Nordic Power Profiler Kit, and others.**
